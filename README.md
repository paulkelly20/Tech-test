The task
We need you to programme a space age calculator.

Don’t worry, it’s not a system for dating a captain’s log. In fact, the task couldn’t be simpler.

Given a person’s age, calculate how old that person would be on different planets.

For simplicity’s sake, here’s a list of planets and their orbit times.

Earth: Orbital period 365.25 Earth days, or 31,557,600 seconds
Mercury: Orbital period 0.2408467 Earth years
Venus: Orbital period 0.61519726 Earth years
Mars: Orbital period 1.8808158 Earth years
Jupiter: Orbital period 11.862615 Earth years
Saturn: Orbital period 29.447498 Earth years
Uranus: Orbital period 84.016846 Earth years
Neptune: Orbital period 164.79132 Earth years
And, depending on your feelings towards Pluto...
Pluto: Orbital period 248.00 Earth years
So, if you were told someone was 1,000,000,000 seconds old, you should be able to say that they're 31 Earth years old.
